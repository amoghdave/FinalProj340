                <p>
                    We wanted to go beyond just providing materials; we wanted to teach,
                    to have a direct connection with these students. And so began our
                    fieldtrip idea.<br> <br>
                    Through Fieldtrip, the kids can experience the world from the luxury
                    of their home or school. We tell stories based on a specific
                    geographical location the children choose from. Then based on each
                    location we provide different genres of stories to keep the children
                    engaged and excited.<br> <br>
                    As the children read more they can also choose more challenging
                    content to read and improve their reading skills while discovering
                    the world.

                how we do it</h2>
            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    There are a few regions on the globe the children can select from and the
                    site navigates to the stories in that region. Then the children can
                    simply pick which story they want to read.<br> <br>
                    Many pictures and videos are supplied with the stories to give the
                    children an audio visual experience of the moment. Education isn't simply
                    an opportunity for kids to memorize curriculum and apply their knowledge,
                    it is also an opportunity for them to grow with the world. Therefore,
                    by reading about various cultural stories from various perspectives
                    can give the children a global outlook on life.

                why we do it</h2>
            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    It all began with an idea to unlock the life-changing power of modern
                    technology, something ignored or forgotten in many developed areas
                    around the world. Kinspire wanted to focus on using this technology
                    in order to ensure that every child has access to a well-rounded
                    schooling. This was, of course, easier said than done. One of the
                    biggest challenges we faced in our initial planning was the fact
                    that in these underprivileged communities, education was a luxury;
                    simply proclaiming that education would be the solution was far from
                    enough. <br> <br>
                    Therefore, we empahsize on the use of technology to bridge the gap
                    between the children and the rest of the world. Through Fieldtrip
                    the kids can learn about a whole different world across the globe.
                    It is meant to be a cultural immersion experience.
